### Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

## Week 15

4 March 2024

Added "member_game_list" column to "Games_Members" table. This column will allow us to
set the games the member saves into either their favorites or wishlist/Want to play list.
An endpoint will neeed to be created to pull a members games set to favorites and another endpoint will be needed to pull a members games set to wishlist/want to play. Wishlist and Want To Play are interchangeable, but wishlist is easier to type for the backend.

Added "attendee_type" column to "Member_events" table. This column will allow members to sign up for events as either a player or a spectator. Two endpoints will need to be created for each of these options. One for a players list and one for a spectators list.
